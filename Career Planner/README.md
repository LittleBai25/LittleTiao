# Career Planning Assistant

A Streamlit-based career planning assistant that analyzes users' academic backgrounds and career interests to generate personalized career planning reports.

## Features

- **Information Collection**: Collect user's university, major, target industry, and position information
- **Transcript Analysis**: Use vision-enabled AI to automatically extract information from transcript images
- **Knowledge Integration**: Query a simulated database for relevant career and industry information
- **Career Planning Reports**: Generate detailed career planning reports with text descriptions and visual diagrams
- **Flexible Agent Settings**: Customize career planning and report submission agents' roles, tasks, and output formats
- **Model Selection**: Choose different language models for different stages of the process
- **API Status Monitoring**: Check the connection status and configuration of required APIs
- **LangSmith Monitoring**: Integrate LangSmith to monitor and analyze AI generation chains

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
- OpenRouter API key (for accessing all language models, including vision models)
- LangSmith API key (for monitoring and analysis)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd career-planner
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. If running locally, create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file:
```toml
OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your_openrouter_api_key_here"
LANGSMITH_API_KEY = "your_langsmith_api_key_here"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT = "career-planner"  # optional
```

4. If deploying on Streamlit Cloud, configure the corresponding secrets in the application settings.

## Usage

1. Launch the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Access the application in your browser (typically at http://localhost:8501)

3. Use the three main tabs:
   - **Information Collection**: Enter personal information and upload transcript
   - **Agent Settings**: Customize AI assistant roles, tasks, output formats, and select models
   - **API Status**: Check API connection and configuration status

## Available Models

The application supports the following AI models through OpenRouter:
- **Qwen Max** (qwen/qwen-max)
- **Qwen 3 32B** (qwen/qwen3-32b:free)
- **DeepSeek Chat v3** (deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free)

For transcript analysis, the application uses Qwen's vision model (qwen/qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct).

## Knowledge Base Design

The application uses a simulated database with the following structure:
- Industries
  - Positions
    - Required Skills
    - Education Requirements 
    - Salary Range
    - Career Prospects
- Majors
  - Suitable Industries
  - Suitable Positions
  - Core Skills
  - Career Paths

## Workflow

1. **Information Collection**: User provides university, major, target industry, target position, and optionally uploads a transcript image.
2. **Transcript Analysis**: If a transcript is uploaded, it's analyzed using Qwen's vision model to extract course information.
3. **Knowledge Query**: The application queries the knowledge database for information relevant to the user's input.
4. **Draft Generation**: A career planning draft is generated by the Career Planning Assistant.
5. **Final Report**: The Report Submission Assistant creates a final report with text and visual diagrams (mind maps and flowcharts).

## Notes

- Transcript uploads only support image formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- At least one of Major, Target Industry, or Target Position must be filled
- Ensure API keys are correctly set and have sufficient usage quota
- LangSmith monitoring helps track the complete process of each generation
- The final report includes Mermaid diagrams for visual representation of career paths and action plans
